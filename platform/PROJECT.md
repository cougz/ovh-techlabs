- [x] **Task ID: DARK-MODE-IMPROVE-004**
  - Description: Fix Dark Mode Color Values (Not Just Classes) - CRITICAL FIX
  - Completed: July 9, 2025
  - Notes: **ROOT CAUSE RESOLVED**: CSS overrides in index.css were using semi-transparent colors (bg-gray-800/50) that made cards nearly invisible. Fixed by updating CSS to use solid slate-800 backgrounds, adding explicit high-contrast CSS rules with !important, and creating comprehensive test suite. Empty state now uses #2d3748 background with #4a5568 border. All 31 Dashboard tests passing. Dark mode now has proper contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA standards.

- [x] **Task ID: DARK-MODE-IMPROVE-005**
  - Description: Fix Dark Mode Text Contrast on Create Workshop Form & Layout Shift Issues
  - Completed: July 9, 2025
  - Notes: FIXED both critical issues: 1) Added proper dark mode text contrast classes to all CreateWorkshop form elements (dark:text-white, dark:text-gray-100, dark:text-gray-300, dark:text-gray-400). 2) LAYOUT SHIFT RESOLVED: Removed 'dark-mode' class addition to document.body which was causing layout shifts. All 6 layout shift tests passing, all 8 text contrast tests passing. Dark mode now provides WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios.

- [x] **Task ID: DARK-MODE-IMPROVE-006**
  - Description: Fix Settings Page Dark Mode Colors
  - Completed: July 9, 2025
  - Notes: TASK COMPLETE: Fixed Settings page dark mode inconsistencies by adding comprehensive dark mode classes throughout the page. Main container now uses dark:bg-slate-800, tab navigation has dark:border-slate-600, form inputs have dark:bg-slate-700 backgrounds, helper text uses dark:text-gray-400, section headers use dark:text-gray-100, and footer uses dark:bg-slate-700. All 10 Settings dark mode tests passing. Settings page now maintains consistent dark theme without light mode islands.

- [x] **Task ID: DARK-MODE-IMPROVE-007**
  - Description: Fix Information Alert Box in Terraform Settings
  - Completed: July 9, 2025
  - Notes: QUICK FIX COMPLETE: Fixed jarring bright yellow/cream alert box in Terraform settings tab. Alert container now uses dark:bg-stone-800 with dark:border-stone-600, warning icon uses dark:text-amber-400, heading uses dark:text-amber-200, and message text uses dark:text-stone-200. Maintains warning semantic meaning while fitting seamlessly into dark theme. All 5 Terraform alert dark mode tests passing. No more "flashlight in the face" effect.

- [x] **Task ID: BULK-IMPORT-001**
  - Description: Implement CSV bulk import functionality for workshop creation
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: FEATURE COMPLETE: Added comprehensive CSV bulk import system to workshop creation page. Features include: CSV parsing and validation utility with proper error handling, real-time CSV validation with user feedback, toggle switch for individual vs bulk import modes, progress tracking during bulk attendee creation, CSV format validation (username,email per line), duplicate detection for usernames and emails, comprehensive test coverage with 30 tests (17 utility + 13 integration tests). Supports clean commit workflow without prohibited Co-authored-by messages. Workshop creation now supports both individual attendee entry and CSV bulk import.

- [x] **Task ID: DARK-MODE-UI-FIX-001**
  - Description: Fix Dark Mode UI Inconsistencies on Dashboard - Remove double borders/containers and nested dark layers
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: UI FIX COMPLETE: Fixed dark mode visual inconsistencies that created "nested/windowed" appearance on Dashboard page. Removed excessive dark mode styling including redundant container backgrounds, double borders, and nested dark layers. Dashboard now uses clean, flat design matching light mode structure. Changes: removed dark styling from main wrapper, eliminated redundant dark classes on stat cards, simplified Recent Workshops section to single-level containers, cleaned empty state styling, let base CSS handle theming. All 8 UI fix tests passing. Dark mode now has professional appearance with visual parity to light theme.

- [x] **Task ID: DOCKER-HEALTH-FIX-001**
  - Description: Fix Docker container health states - resolve database schema mismatch for timezone and template columns
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: DOCKER FIX COMPLETE: Fixed critical database schema mismatch that was causing Docker containers to switch to unhealthy states. Root cause was missing timezone and template columns in database schema that SQLAlchemy models expected. Fixed by: updating schema.sql to include timezone VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'UTC' NOT NULL and template VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Generic' NOT NULL columns, updating workshop_summary view to include new columns, creating .env file with required environment variables, rebuilding containers with fresh database. All containers now starting successfully and remaining healthy - API, Celery workers, and beat scheduler all operational without schema errors.

- [x] **Task ID: CELERY-HEALTH-FIX-001**
  - Description: Fix Celery containers health checks - replace incorrect HTTP checks with Celery-specific checks
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: CELERY HEALTH FIX COMPLETE: Fixed improper health check configuration that was causing Celery containers to show as unhealthy despite working correctly. Root cause was hardcoded HTTP health check in Dockerfile inherited by all containers. Fixed by: removing hardcoded HEALTHCHECK from Dockerfile, adding proper Celery worker health check using 'celery -A main.celery inspect ping', adding Celery beat health check using Python process verification, configuring health checks per service in docker-compose.yml with 40s start_period. Celery Worker now shows as healthy, both containers fully functional. This resolves the Docker health state issues where containers appeared unhealthy but were processing tasks correctly.

- [x] **Task ID: TERRAFORM-NAMING-FIX-001**
  - Description: Fix Terraform resource naming format to comply with OVH IAM policy naming requirements
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: TERRAFORM NAMING FIX COMPLETE: Fixed OVH IAM policy naming error that occurred with usernames containing special characters like dots, spaces, and @ symbols. Root cause was using raw usernames for IAM policy names which violates OVH naming rules (alphanumeric and -, /, _, + only). Fixed by: adding sanitized_username local variable in Terraform template that converts to lowercase and replaces dots, spaces, @ symbols with dashes, updating ovh_iam_policy resource to use sanitized name while preserving original username for descriptions and login. Example: 'Max.Mustermann' becomes 'max-mustermann' for policy naming. Resolves "Policy name is not formatted properly" error while maintaining user-friendly display names. Comprehensive test suite added to validate sanitization logic.

- [x] **Task ID: BULK-IMPORT-FORMAT-001**
  - Description: Enforce CSV bulk import format to be username,email (no dots allowed in username)
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: CSV FORMAT VALIDATION COMPLETE: Enhanced bulk import validation to enforce OVH-compliant username formats. Added comprehensive validation rules to prevent dots, spaces, and special characters in usernames during CSV import. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and plus (+) symbols are now allowed. Provides specific error messages for common invalid characters like dots and spaces, guiding users to use dashes instead. Updated all existing tests to use valid username formats. This ensures usernames are compatible with OVH IAM policy naming requirements from the point of data entry, eliminating downstream Terraform errors.

- [x] **Task ID: WORKSHOP-DESCRIPTION-001**
  - Description: Update workshop project description from 'Workshop project' to 'TechLabs environment'
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: PROJECT DESCRIPTION UPDATE COMPLETE: Updated all OVH cloud project descriptions to use 'TechLabs environment' branding instead of generic 'Workshop project' naming. Changes include: default project description in terraform_service changed from 'Workshop Project' to 'TechLabs environment', dynamic project description format in terraform_tasks updated from 'Workshop project for {username}' to 'TechLabs environment for {username}'. Updated test configurations to reflect new naming convention. Provides more professional and consistent branding for OVH cloud projects created through the automation system.

- [x] **Task ID: IAM-POLICY-UPDATES-001**
  - Description: Update IAM policy name format and description to include username and PCI project information
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: IAM POLICY IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETE: Enhanced IAM policy naming and descriptions for better clarity and compliance. Updated IAM policy name format from simple sanitized username to 'access-grant-for-pci-project-{sanitized-username}' for better identification. Updated policy description from generic 'Policy for {username}' to descriptive 'Grants access to {username} for PCI project {project-id}' including both username and actual project ID. These changes provide more context and traceability for IAM policies while maintaining OVH naming compliance. Updated test expectations to match new format.

- [x] **Task ID: PLACEHOLDER-FORMAT-VERIFICATION-001**
  - Description: Verify and fix CSV bulk import preview text and individual attendee form placeholders for OVH compliance
  - Completed: July 21, 2025
  - Notes: PLACEHOLDER FORMAT VERIFICATION COMPLETE: Comprehensive validation confirmed all placeholder formats are already OVH-compliant and consistent. CSV bulk import textarea shows 'Max-Mustermann,max-mustermann@techlab.ovh' without mailto: prefix, individual attendee form shows 'john-doe' and 'john-doe@example.com' with consistent dash formatting. All username formats avoid dots, spaces, and special characters, ensuring compatibility with OVH IAM policy naming requirements. CSV import functionality tested and confirmed working with username,email format. All existing validation tests (21 tests) passing, ensuring format consistency across all form fields.

## Important Context

### Known Issues
- **RESOLVED**: ~~OVH network restriction blocking cloud project creation~~
  - **Resolution**: Switched to new OVH account credentials, full functionality restored
  - **Status**: System fully operational as of July 8, 2025

### Architecture Decisions
- **Decision**: Use FastAPI for backend REST API
  - Rationale: High performance, automatic OpenAPI documentation, excellent TypeScript integration
  - Date: Project inception

- **Decision**: React with TypeScript for frontend
  - Rationale: Type safety, component reusability, excellent developer experience
  - Date: Project inception

- **Decision**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
  - Rationale: ACID compliance, complex query support, excellent Python integration
  - Date: Project inception

- **Decision**: Docker Compose for deployment
  - Rationale: Container orchestration, service isolation, easy deployment
  - Date: Project inception

- **Decision**: Terraform for infrastructure management
  - Rationale: Infrastructure as Code, OVH provider support, state management
  - Date: Project inception

### External Dependencies
- **API**: OVH Public Cloud API
  - Endpoint: https://api.ovh.com/1.0/
  - Auth: Application key, secret, and consumer key
  - Rate limits: Standard OVH API limits

### Gotchas & Learnings
- OVH API requires specific plan codes for different regions
- Terraform state management is critical for proper cleanup
- WebSocket connections need proper error handling for deployment status
- JWT tokens require secure storage and proper refresh mechanisms
- Docker health checks are essential for proper service orchestration
- TypeScript strict mode requires eliminating all 'any' types for better type safety
- Schema-first development with Zod provides runtime validation and single source of truth for types
- useEffect with conditional returns can trigger "not all code paths return a value" errors in strict mode
- Jest configuration for testing Redux slices requires careful setup for axios mocking
- Production build issues should be resolved through TDD using test-driven validation
- Unused imports and variables in development files can cause TypeScript build failures
- Component interface changes must be synchronized with all usage locations
- **@types/jest is essential** for proper Jest type definitions - install with `npm install --save-dev @types/jest`
- **Redux slice testing requires importing reducer, not slice**: Use `import authReducer from '../authSlice'` not `import { authSlice }`
- **Mock API services not HTTP libraries**: Test Redux slices by mocking the API service layer (`services/api`) rather than axios directly
- **Generic syntax in .tsx files**: Use `<T,>` instead of `<T>` to prevent TypeScript from interpreting generics as JSX elements
- **PreloadedState vs Partial**: Use `Partial<RootState>` in test utilities instead of `PreloadedState` for better compatibility
- **Behavior over implementation in tests**: Focus tests on state changes and business behavior rather than internal implementation details like localStorage calls
- **Error handling validation**: Always validate that error detail fields are strings before using them to prevent object serialization issues
- **Timezone-aware development**: Use `datetime.now(ZoneInfo("UTC"))` instead of `datetime.utcnow()` for timezone-aware operations
- **Database migrations**: Always add NOT NULL columns with DEFAULT values to avoid migration issues with existing data
- **Template system extensibility**: Design template systems with configuration objects to support future resource types without code changes
- **Pydantic validator inheritance**: Child schemas inherit parent validators, making validation composition straightforward
- **SVG component testing**: Use `screen.getByTitle()` and `.closest('svg')` to properly test SVG React components, as they don't have standard `img` roles
- **Corporate branding integration**: Implement brand colors in Tailwind config, create reusable logo components, and apply consistent styling throughout the application
- **OVH brand colors**: Primary brand color is `#000e9c` - use this consistently across UI elements for proper corporate identity
- **SVG accessibility**: Always add `role="img"` and `aria-label` attributes to SVG components for proper accessibility
- **SVG color theming**: Use `fill: currentColor` instead of hardcoded colors to enable proper CSS theming and dark/light mode support
- **SVG layout structure**: Use dedicated CSS classes (logo-container, logo-svg, logo-text) for consistent layout and easy maintenance
- **SVG responsive design**: Use `width="auto"` and explicit height values to maintain aspect ratio across different screen sizes
- **Dark mode theme persistence**: Use localStorage to save theme preference and restore on page load, with proper fallback for system preference detection
- **Animated theme switches**: Custom CSS animations with complex transitions require careful state management - use proper checkbox input with label wrapper for accessibility
- **localStorage testing**: Jest environment requires proper mocking of localStorage with actual mock implementations, not just jest.fn() - create complete Storage interface mocks
- **matchMedia browser API**: Not available in Jest test environment - wrap in try-catch with proper fallback behavior for server-side rendering compatibility
- **Theme switch CSS variables**: Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming across complex animations with multiple states and transitions
- **Tailwind dark mode configuration**: Must set `darkMode: 'class'` in tailwind.config.js and add 'dark' class to document.documentElement (not just body) for proper theme switching
- **Dark mode styles**: Define dark mode styles using Tailwind's dark: prefix or custom CSS with .dark parent selector for comprehensive theme support
- **CRITICAL - Dark mode CSS override issue**: Custom CSS in index.css can override Tailwind classes with semi-transparent colors (bg-gray-800/50) making elements nearly invisible. Always use solid colors for dark mode (bg-slate-800) and add explicit CSS rules with !important for critical visibility. Test actual color values, not just class presence. Semi-transparent backgrounds often fail in dark mode due to poor contrast.
- **Layout shift from body class manipulation**: Adding CSS classes to document.body can cause layout shifts during theme switching. Only modify document.documentElement for Tailwind dark mode ('dark' class). Body class changes trigger reflows and cause jarring UX. Use document.documentElement.classList.add('dark') exclusively for theme switching.
- **Text contrast hierarchy in dark mode**: Establish clear contrast hierarchy: page titles (dark:text-white), section headers (dark:text-gray-100), form labels (dark:text-gray-300), helper text (dark:text-gray-400), icons (dark:text-gray-500). This ensures WCAG AA compliance and proper visual hierarchy.
- **Settings page dark mode pattern**: Use consistent dark mode styling across form-heavy pages: main containers (dark:bg-slate-800), form inputs (dark:bg-slate-700, dark:border-slate-600, dark:text-gray-100), tab navigation (dark:border-slate-600), and footer sections (dark:bg-slate-700). This eliminates light mode islands and provides seamless dark theme integration.
- **Alert boxes in dark mode**: Warning/information alert boxes should use subtle dark backgrounds (dark:bg-stone-800) instead of bright colors. Warning icons use dark:text-amber-400, headings use dark:text-amber-200, and message text uses dark:text-stone-200. This maintains semantic meaning while preventing jarring bright flashes in dark mode.
- **CRITICAL - Co-Authored-By violations**: Never add Co-authored-by messages in commit messages. Three commits violated this rule and were cleaned up using git filter-branch. Always check commit messages before pushing to ensure compliance with guidelines.
- **CSV file parsing patterns**: Use split() and trim() operations for simple CSV parsing with proper error handling. Always validate format and content separately. For complex CSV files, consider using dedicated CSV parsing libraries.
- **Real-time form validation**: Implement validation state updates on each input change event, clearing errors immediately when data becomes valid. This provides better user experience than validation only on submit.
- **React toggle switches**: For accessible toggle switches without predefined components, use CSS classes to select elements in tests instead of role-based selection. Custom toggle switches may not have standard ARIA roles.
- **Bulk operation progress tracking**: Show progress indicators during async bulk operations with real-time completion counts. Handle partial failures gracefully by collecting and displaying errors while allowing successful operations to complete.
- **Test async operations**: Use controlled promises (Promise + resolve function) to test components during async operations. This allows testing intermediate states like loading indicators and progress displays.
- **CSV validation error formatting**: Structure CSV validation errors with line numbers and context (field names, values, original lines) for clear user feedback. Separate parsing errors from validation errors to provide specific guidance.
- **Form mode switching**: When switching between different form modes (individual vs bulk), clear all mode-specific state to prevent confusion. Reset form data, errors, and validation state when changing modes.
- **Test data factories**: Create factory functions with optional overrides for consistent test data generation. Use Partial<T> types for override parameters to maintain type safety while allowing flexible test setup.
- **Dark mode inline class conflicts**: Adding inline dark mode classes (dark:bg-slate-800, dark:border-2, etc.) to components that already have CSS-based dark mode styling creates visual conflicts and nested container effects. Always prefer CSS-based theming (.dark .card) over inline Tailwind dark classes. Inline dark classes should only be used for text colors and specific styling that can't be handled by base CSS selectors. This prevents "double border" and "nested container" visual problems in dark mode.
- **OVH IAM policy naming restrictions**: OVH IAM policy names must only contain alphanumeric characters and -, /, _, + symbols. Usernames with dots, spaces, @ symbols, or other special characters will cause "Policy name is not formatted properly" errors. Always sanitize usernames for resource naming by replacing invalid characters with dashes and converting to lowercase. Use local variables in Terraform to create sanitized versions while preserving original usernames for descriptions and login purposes. Example transformation: 'Max.Mustermann@domain.com' â†’ 'max-mustermann-at-domain-com'.

## Next Session Starting Point

**Priority**: Fix Workshop Status Inconsistency (STATUS-FIX-001)
**Current State**: Production deployment fully verified with all core features implemented. New bug fixes and improvements identified for enhanced user experience.
**Next Action**: Implement proper workshop status management to ensure status accurately reflects deployment state

## Pending Tasks Details

### STATUS-FIX-001: Fix Workshop Status Inconsistency
**Issue**: Workshop remains in "planning" state even when all attendees are deployed. Sidebar shows "Ready to deploy" while attendees are already deployed.
**Solution**: Implement automatic status transitions based on attendee deployment state.

### PASSWORD-GEN-001: Implement Random Password Generation  
**Issue**: Hardcoded password "TempPassword123!" is a security risk.
**Solution**: Generate unique, secure passwords for each attendee.

### LOGIN-PREFIX-001: Configurable Login Prefix System
**Issue**: OVHcloud login prefix "0541-8821-89/" is hardcoded.
**Solution**: Add Settings page to configure prefix and export format.

### RETRY-DEPLOY-001: Add Deployment Retry Functionality
**Issue**: No way to retry failed deployments.
**Solution**: Add retry buttons and automatic retry with exponential backoff.

### CLEANUP-NOTIFY-001: Environment Cleanup Notification with TDD
**Issue**: Users don't know when environments will be automatically deleted.
**Solution**: Display cleanup time notification based on workshop end time + delay.
