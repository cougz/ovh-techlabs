## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running the Platform

The automation platform manages workshop deployments:

```bash
cd platform

# 1. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OVHcloud credentials and configuration

# 2. Start the platform
docker compose up -d
```

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Environment Configuration

The platform requires proper environment configuration before deployment. Key settings include:

- **OVHcloud API credentials** (get from [api.ovh.com/createToken](https://api.ovh.com/createToken/))
- **Database and Redis connection settings**
- **Security keys and JWT configuration**
- **Terraform and deployment settings**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values for your environment:

```bash
cd platform
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your actual credentials
```

**Important**: Never commit your actual `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive credentials.

### Viewing Workbooks

The workbooks provide tutorial content:

```bash
cd workbooks
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

View documentation at `http://localhost:8000`
